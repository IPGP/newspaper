A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at http://codepen.io/silkine/pen/jldif.

 Just experimenting a bit around with what you can do with webfonts and ligatures and only two font families: Playfair (Google Webfont) and Droid Serif (Google Webfont). Trying to find that one or two tweaks to make the design feel newspapery.
