The Bois de Vincennes, located on the eastern edge of Paris, is the largest public park in the city. It was created between 1855 and 1866 by the Emperor Napoleon III.

The park is next to the Château de Vincennes, a former residence of the Kings of France. It contains an English landscape garden with four lakes; a zoo; an arboretum; a botanical garden; a hippodrome or horse-racing track; a velodrome for bicycle races; and the campus of the French national institute of sports and physical education.

The Bois de Vincennes has a total area of 995 hectares, making it slightly larger than the Bois de Boulogne, (846 hectares), the other great Parisian landscape park located at the western side of the city. It occupies ten percent of the total area of Paris, and is almost as large as the first six arrondissements in the center of the city combined. The Bois de Vincennes is about three times larger than Central Park in New York City (341 hectares), and is similar in size to Richmond Park in London (955 hectares); but is smaller than Griffith Park in Los Angeles (1,170 hectares). Only about half of the Bois de Vincennes is covered with trees.
