The <b> Maison Européenne de la Photographie </b> (or MEP), located in the historic heart of Paris, is a major center for contemporary photographic art which opened in February 1996.<br />
<BR>
The <i>Hotel Henault de Cantobre</i>, which was built in 1706, houses the Maison Européenne de la Photographie and is located at n. 5, Rue de Fourcy. It belongs to the City of Paris since 1914. The city authorities asked the Yves Lion firm of architects to undertake the restoration of the original building, as well as the addition of a new wing on the Rue de Fourcy. The façade overlooking the street, the period ironwork and the central staircase are all examples of classical architecture.<br />

The collection is dedicated to the contemporary creation. It owns about twenty thousands works of art, mostly photographs (silver and digital photography) and videos. The library gathers 24.000 volumes about photography, artists’ books as well as technical or theoretical works, including rare editions. Three or four exhibition cycles are organized every year about artists, themes and movements which mainly belong to the second half of the 20th century and the 21st century.<br />

The Maison Européenne de la Photographie is directed since 1996 by Jean-Luc Monterosso (Director) and Henry Chapier (President).
