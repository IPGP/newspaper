The grounds of the Jardin des Plantes includes four galleries of the Muséum: 
the Grande Galerie de l'Évolution, the Mineralogy Museum, the Paleontology 
Museum and the Entomology Museum. In addition to the gardens there is also 
a smull zoo, Ménagerie du Jardin des plantes, founded in 1795 by Bernardin de 
Saint-Pierre from animals of the royal menagerie at Versailles.

The Jardin des Plantes maintains a botanical school, which trains botanists, 
constructs demonstration gardens, and exchanges seeds to maintain biotic 
diversity. About 4500 plants are arranged by family on a one hectare 
(10,000 m²) plot. Three hectares are devoted to horticultural displays of 
decorative plants. An Alpine garden has 3000 species with world-wide 
representation. Specialized buildings, such as a large Art Deco winter garden, and Mexican and Australian hothouses display regional
plants, not native to France. The Rose Garden, created in 1990, has hundreds 
of species of roses and rose trees
