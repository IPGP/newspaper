On the occasion of the Exposition Universelle of 1900, Bartholdi crafted a smaller version of the Statue of Liberty, which he subsequently gave to the Musée du Luxembourg. In 1905, the statue was placed outside the museum in the Jardin du Luxembourg, where it stood for over a century, until 2012. It currently stands at the entrance to the Musée d'Orsay; a newly constructed bronze replica stands in its place in the Jardin du Luxembourg.[1]

This statue is near the Grenelle Bridge on the Île aux Cygnes, a man-made island in the Seine (48°51′0″N 2°16′47″E). It is 11.50 metres (37 feet 9 inches) high and weighs 14 tons.[3] Inaugurated on July 4, 1889, it looks southwest, downriver along the Seine. Its tablet bears two dates: "IV JUILLET 1776" (July 4, 1776: the United States Declaration of Independence) like the New York statue, and "XIV JUILLET 1789" (July 14, 1789: the storming of the Bastille) associated with an equal sign. This statue is shown in the movie National Treasure: Book of Secrets as one of the historic locations.
