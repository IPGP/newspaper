This charming street is located in the 12th arrondissement, between Rue de Lyon and Rue de Bercy. It is a little street, 144 metres long, that is pedestrianised and cobblestoned and gives visitors the impression that they have left Paris behind. There are no Haussmann style buildings here, only unquestionably charming little houses. Their particularity is that the fa√ßades are mainly in gentle pastel colours. From the green at number 21 to the blue at 22, the purple at 23, the yellow at 24, the pink at 30‚Ä¶ And when the colours are not attracting your eye, it will be drawn to the trompes l‚Äô≈ìil that decorate the fa√ßades, with a cat hunting delicately painted birds or a lilac that surrounds an entrance. Animals of the feline variety (real ones) must think themselves in the countryside among the flower pots that are lined up outside the houses and visitors will have a similar feeling over the course of this short, but delightful stroll.

Rue Cr√©mieux is beginning to fall victim to its success and you may well not be the only one taking photographs in this street whose fa√ßades are reminiscent of Portobello in London or Burano in Venice. The light plays with the colours all day long, so much so that fashion bloggers have made it their favourite spot for presenting the latest outfits. Here‚Äôs some advice so that this little piece of paradise remains one ‚Äì be discreet! Rue Cr√©mieux 75012 Paris
