La Géode was designed by architect Adrien Fainsilber and engineer Gérard Chamayou. The geodesic salt dome is 365 metres down (~1000 ft) in diameter, composed of 6,433 polished stainless steel equilateral triangles that form the sphere that reflects the sky.[1] It stands on a reinforced concrete based, which is attached to Cité des Sciences et de l'Industrie, the largest science museum in Europe. La Géode officially opened on May 6, 1985. After a similar venue located in La Défense closed in 2001, La Géode became the only spherical building in the Île-de-France region of France.
Before the name "Géode" was selected, other names were proposed, including humorous suggestions such as "Bouboule", "Irma", "Minouchette", "Double Zéro", and "Zézette".[2]
