  and, as I lie close to the earth, a thousand unknown plants are noticed by me:
  when I hear the buzz of the little world among the stalks, and grow familiar
  with the countless indescribable forms of the insects and flies, then I feel
  the presence of the Almighty, who formed us in his own image, and the breath
  of that universal love which bears and sustains us, as it floats around us in
  an eternity of bliss; and then, my friend, when darkness overspreads my eyes,
  and heaven and earth seem to dwell in my soul and absorb its power, like the
  form of a beloved mistress, then I often think with longing, Oh, would I could
  describe these conceptions, could impress upon paper all that is living so
  full and warm within me, that it might be the mirror of my soul, as my soul is
  the mirror of the infinite God!
